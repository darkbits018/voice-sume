128:::Systems/network administrator;Network Administrator:::Systems/network administrator Systems/network administrator Lumberton, NC I have 12 years of on the job IT experience as both a network and systems administrator. During which time I have accomplished many feats, including assisting with mergers, and suggesting new technologies to increase the companies efficiency and effectiveness. I have an outstanding track record, for problem solving (getting to the root of an issue), meeting company objective and goals, and making/meeting deadlines. I also have outstanding verbal skills, which makes communicating difficult/complicated IT information easier. Work Experience Systems/network administrator Provider Resources INC October 2016 to June 2018 Deployment Engineer - deployed updates/upgrades that were created by the development team, this ranged from SQL database changes to client website updates, and included reviewing deployment documentation for errors, and pointing out areas where improvements to the process could be made. ? Kept PRI's external facing Wordpress website up to date with any changes that were requested. ? Kept PRI's share point intranet site up to date with the most recent renditions of corporate documentation and weekly news. ? Created, updated, and removed User accounts in both Active Directory and Linux ? Tasked with reviewing hundreds of IT security tickets then notifying the IT Tech Lead and IT Project Manager who would be best suited to work them based on their skill levels. Undertaking this allowed me to create deployment outlines for almost half of the tickets before they were sent on to the Tech lead and IT Project Manager saving time and effort. ? When not doing system admin duties I assisted the help desk, I was able to reduce the backlog of tickets by 40% in my first few weeks with the company ? Stood up new environments (configuring IIS and database settings). ? Worked on improving processes/reports via scripting or changing methodology. ? Administered WebEx portal. user administration and communication trouble shooting ? Administered the Learning management system (LMS) system, user administration and site updates. ? Shared database administration duties with the IT tech Lead; an example of this is researching and creating the process used to encrypt all of PRI's Databases/database instances. Then created the process on how to move those encrypted databases from one server environment and restore it in another. ? A letter of recommendation is available upon request. Network Administrator Oakland County Credit Union June 2006 to October 2016 Managed OCCU's network, communication, and server infrastructures. ? My direct report was to the Vice President of Information Technology. ? I set obtainable objectives and goals for IT projects that aligned with the Credit Unions vision. ? Lead a small team of 2 data entry processors. ? Managed the firewalls and IPS/IDS systems of the Credit Union. ? Saved the Credit Union $80,000 when bidding out the rebuild of our data center. I did this by working out a deal where our current Tech Vendor preformed the setups and installs. However, all of the hardware was purchased through a new vendor. Creating a new purchasing relationship while maintaining our currently existing one. ? I worked with staff and members to trouble-shoot technical issues that they may be having with Credit Union software programs and web sites. Going so far as to go to members' homes and work on their personal computers to get our site up and running for them. (I will go the extra mile needed to succeed) ? I was the Technical Lead on 5 congruent projects. This included a merger, a phone system upgrade/overhaul, and 3 different new Systems/software installs. A new core server install/upgrade, a new lending platform, and a new signature platform (using tablets for sig pads) ? Delegated jobs/tasks to peers/colleagues and Company Branches based on their skill levels. I knew who could do what at each branch and if they were available I would walk them through the trouble shooting steps to see if that would resolve the issue prior to myself going onsite. Was able to see that one of the data entry processors was better suited for a higher roll in our IT department. I then recommended to upper management that we create a new position (IT project coordinator), and then recommended that this data entry processor be placed in this new roll. The new roll was created and the recommended employee was placed in it. This placement made the IT department more efficient in the long run and allowed for us to have more IT staff. ? Trouble shooting/problem solving skills. I want to leave you with this example: with just two weeks under my belt, the only other IT tech at the CU quit. Leaving me with just the basics and some documentation for the core system (which is a self-proprietary software solution). And as luck would have it 2 days after his departure the core locked up, causing the CU to go into full panic mode (members could not get to there money). I was able to keep calm (I work well under pressure) and told the core company that there has to be something in one of the alternate directories that was causing the server to lock up. Because of my inexperience they would not listen to me. So after about 45 minutes of digging I was able to see that one of the other directories (called ALT) was causing a file full error. Once the core company cleared out the files we then looked for the root cause. The determination was that it was the automated jobs processing system that was being tested in ALT was causing the issue. Once turned off this file full error in ALT never occurred again during my time with the CU.

Also RIL (radio interface layer) functionality.?  C++ developer. Developed dll for Koolspan's SDK used by C/C# in Mobile Windows and? Win32.? Environment: C, C++, UNIX, Free TDS? ? Stony Brook, NY? Role: Developer? ? Linux System Call Inheritance? ? Currently the Linux kernel has a predefined set of system calls, each identified with a unique system call number and a specific handler. The kernel stores this information in the form of a table called sys_call_table indexed with the system call number and uses it as an index to find the function pointers for a specific system call. This table is not exported as a symbol. Hence it is impossible to add a new system call to the kernel at run time. If new functionality is to be added, we either need to statically add a new system call to the kernel or override an existing one.? ? However, both of these approaches require significant amount of kernel knowledge and cannot be implemented on a per-process basis.? ? Our project implements two solutions for the same.? ?  First implementation is based on the conception that a system call can be instrumented or probed using kprobes. This method allows to put an instrumentation function (called before the original system call) and a callback function (invoked after the original system call) anywhere in the kernel. Thus, creating a system call wrapper.?  Second implementation performs system call interception by hijacking the syscall table. The address of the sys call table is obtained and using the preset syscall numbers, the function pointers to the original system calls are manipulated to point to our custom defined system call definitions.? ? Thus achieving syscall overriding.? ? Environment: C/C++, Unix, Bash C++ Developer L-3 GSI - Fairfax, VA - August 2009 to May 2010 Responsibilities:?

Environment: C, Sockets, Unix, Bash Developer HSBC, India - Mumbai, Maharashtra - September 2008 to August 2009 Time Series Forecasting Using Holt Winter Series at IIT Bombay? ? ? Improving the accuracy of forecasting process is necessary to uplift the quality of management decisions. From the earlier work in this area one can conclude that preprocessing (decomposition) and post-processing (combining) when applied to the time series result in increase in the accuracy of the forecasts which is the main aim of the forecasting process.? ? ?
