45:::Database Marketing Coordinator;Marketing Database Coordinator;Database Marketing Specialist:::Database Marketing Coordinator Milwaukee, WI - Work Experience Database Marketing Coordinator Foley & Lardner LLP - Milwaukee, WI - May 2010 to Present Responsibilities? - administer firm's SQL-based Customer Relationship (CRM) database? - create and design SQL reports of CRM data? - administer SQL jobs pulling data into CRM from other systems (Accounting, HR, external files, etc.)? - manage technical projects (examples: develop a Web-based form powered by a SQL database to compile data and report on it, test and deploy software for marketing department use)? - develop and maintain Web-based event registration pages? - develop and deploy e-mail and e-marketing campaigns? - troubleshoot and provide solutions for issues with various internal technical productions (why is this process failing? why is this character displaying strangely in this email? what changed in our environment that caused this job to encounter issues? where is the data that populates this (very old) report coming from?)? ? Accomplishments? Since joining the firm I've streamlined several internal processes to provide single data sources and eliminate duplication of efforts. I've become the go-to technical person within my department when someone runs into an issue or into a problem they can't figure out. I've helped to streamline our e-marketing campaigns by developing templates that use variables (versus the old way of creating multiple new files for each event). I've also worked with my team to provide more concise training and quick reference guides to give staff access to what they need to do their job *when* they need it.? ? Skills Used? - Extensive leadership and organizational skills - I've always worked in an office other than the one my boss works in. It's not uncommon for us to go days without checking in with each other. He trusts me to do my job and prioritize my work schedule so as to meet deadlines and client expectations.? - I'm a very organized project manager - I've been brought into projects that were a complete MESS because I'm known for my ability to assess the situation, pull together the right resources and get a project back on track.? - I've also shown over the years my ability to learn as I go - many times I've been brought into projects where, initially, I may not have had all of the technical understanding necessary to complete the job, but have either taught myself or found resources to learn the skills needed to understand and then execute the job as needed. Marketing Database Coordinator Reinhart Boerner Van Deuren s.c. - Milwaukee, WI - April 2009 to April 2010 Responsibilities? - Administer firm's SQL-based Customer Relationship (CRM) database? - Create training curriculum & documentation for attorneys and staff (2 separate programs) on the usage of the firm's CRM system? - Trained the trainers on CRM software for both attorney and staff programs? - Create software deployment plan for distributing CRM software to all attorneys and staff? - Administer the firm's e-marketing software platform, including sending all e-marketing communications, creating and maintaining all event registration pages, and communicating stats and trends on e-marketing data to management staff? - Work with designers and writers to educate them on SPAM buzzwords and avoiding them in their design and copy to improve email delivery rates? - Work with designers to test e-marketing communications in different browsers, and running HTML files through various litmus tests for email deliverability? ? Accomplishments? - Completed the roll-out of CRM software to all attorneys and staff? - Streamlined e-marketing campaign processes to include multiple browser and litmus tests for maximum deliverability? - Educated marketing staff on the details of email deliverability and online maximization (what buzz-words to stay away from in email copy, what SEO keywords we might want to include (or not include) in our HTML files, etc.)? - Developed training curriculum on CRM system and created documentation (quick reference guides, "how-to" step-by-step instructions)? ? Skills Used? - I showcased my high level of understanding of e-marketing campaigns, and helped to set standards for marketing email communications? - Used my well-developed communication skills to develop a training curriculum, product documentation and end user reference guides? - The last four months of my employment here was as an off-site employee. Not reporting to a physical office every day can mean disaster when you're working very closely with members of various departments on a project, but if you're well organized and a good communicator, being physically removed from your co-workers won't matter. Database Marketing Specialist Foley & Lardner LLP - Milwaukee, WI - September 2002 to April 2009 Responsibilities? - Create training curriculum & documentation for attorneys and staff (2 separate programs) on the usage of the firm's CRM system? - Trained the trainers on CRM software for both attorney and staff programs? - Administer the firm's e-marketing software platform, including sending all e-marketing communications, creating and maintaining all event registration pages, and communicating stats and trends on e-marketing data to management staff? - Act as content manager for the firm's external and internal Web sites (through 2005), editing attorney photos and bios? ? Accomplishments? - Developed a training program for CRM software and traveled to several offices to train trainers and attorney pilot groups? - Created training documents for CRM software, both product documentation and end user reference guides? - Implemented an external Web site where attorneys and management staff can order logo-ed apparel and other items, as well as shifted distribution of printed materials to an off-site vendor (meaning that I didn't have to keep inventory in the office and mail out orders as needed; instead one of our print vendors did that as part of a contract we worked out with them)? - Developed a Web-based form for the submission of creative projects, including a job numbering and organizational system still in place today? ? Skills Used? - High level of organizational skills? - An understanding of business needs and how to translate them into a technical product (i.e. We needed a better tool with which our marketing staff could submit a job request to the creative team. I worked with technology staff to create an online form, a back-end database, and a job numbering system.)? - The ability to stretch myself technically - if there was something I needed to learn in order to complete a project, I learned it and understood it well.
